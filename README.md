# Theia
The Greek goddess of sight, mother of Helios, and...that's it. Theia app is aiming to be an open-source project where budding computer vision students can find not only information but interactive demos to go with their learnings.

## Roadmap
The roadmap is split into several topics in Computer Vision that may require a similar tooling and design

## 1. Image operations
    1. Single pixel (point) operations
    2. Convolutions and other neighborhood ops
    3. Fourier Transforms playground
        1. Image Pyramids
        2. Wavelets
    4. Feature detection/matching (SIFT, SURF, FAST)
        1. Keypoint detection
        2. Edge detection
        3. Hough Lines/Circles
    5. Segmentation
    6. Image stitching (long term)
## 2. Arch improvements (DB etc.)
    1. Result caching (high priority)
    2. Hosting support
    3. Unified design language
## 3. Key site features/USPs
    1. Interactive viewer
        1. Displays results and values
        2. Toggles summary statistics (global constrast, histogram etc.)
    2. Tree/Roadmaps for specializations
    3. In-site resources to books, papers, and further studies
